# Project: Weather App

## Using

- Next.Ts
- Chakra-ui


## Purpose

- The vanila branch was for learning how to work with async requests and api.
This branch is to review React, and learing Next.ts and chakra-ui in preparation for the front-end of the Blog api project.

- Unfortunately, the free version of openweather api uses http, so it is blocked by default on browsers.
