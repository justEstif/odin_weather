#+title: Project Weather App

* Functions:
+ able to search for a specific location and toggle displaying the data in F or C
+ changes the look of the page based on the data
  + you can use an outside api to search for corresponding media to display

* Steps:
1. html, js, css files
2. functions to connect to api, take search terms and return weather for that location
3. function that process the JSON data and return the required data
4. form that will let users input their location and will fetch the weather info
5. display info on page
6. style and maybe add loading component while api is fetching info

* Problem Solving
1. Understand and explain the problem to a duck
   - I will be using AccuWeather, it is better documented

   - I will request the weather data of the searched city
     - AccuWeather City Search API to get city key
     - pass the city key to weather return function
     - I need to async functions to search the request and retrieve the requested info

   - I need the front-end to change based on the returned response
     - It has to change the icon based on the returned weather
     - The display has to change based on the returned
     - It displays what was last searched; it needs to use the local storage API
2. Plan
   - Two module: weather and UI
   - Weather Module
     - searches city
       - form input passed to getCityKey function
     - getCityKey functions passes cityKey to getWeather function
       - *TODO: what if there is no city key returned?*
         - form validation I think
       - returns weather object
     - formatWeatherObject
       - returns the required data to UI function
   - UI Module
     - onStart
       - checkLocalStorage: function to check localStorage
         - if there is value, will return that
       - function to load last search from local storage or an empty page
     - passSearched
       - function to trim, validate and pass searched term to getCityKey
     - *TODO: what to do about the front-end?*
3. Pseudocode and research applicable functions
   1. to get city
      -`http://dataservice.accuweather.com/locations/v1/cities/search?apikey=${API_KEY}&q=${search_term}`
   2. to get weather
      - `http://dataservice.accuweather.com/currentconditions/v1/${city_key}?apikey=${API_KEY}`

4. Divide and conquer
* Completed
- Done with the functions that relate to getting input and outputting weather object
  - style the output and make sure it matches with the weather object
    - show corresponding icons
    - show corresponding day/night picture
  - switch between F and C
* Final Notes
- I have decided that the since the styling isn't the most important part of this page, I will continue with the ciriculum once I make sure all the requirements are completed.
- Features to implement at a later date:
  - more api's to show other weather related information
    - wind
    - weather in upcoming days and hours
    - using queryselector instead of just adding the html to the page
